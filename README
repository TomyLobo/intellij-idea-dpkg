SYNOPSIS

  ./build-package -f <flavor> -p <platform> -v <version>

DESCRIPTION

  build-package will create a platform-specific package of Jetbrain's
  Intellij IDEA. The packages can be installed using platform
  specific/native tools and/or distributed from local package
  repositories. It currently only supports building packages of the
  development builds of IDEA.

OPTIONS

  -f <flavor>

    The IDEA flavor to package. 'flavor' can be one of 'IU' and 'IC'
    for IDEA Ultimate or IDEA Community Edition respectively.

  -p <platform>

    The operating system platform to build the package for. Can be one
    of 'debian' and 'solaris'.
    
    'debian' will build a package for any of the Debian based Linux
    distributions, including Debian and Ubuntu.

    'solaris' will build a package for Solaris 8 to 10. The package itself
    will work on later versions of Solaris and OpenSolaris but uses the
    'old style' packaging tools (pkgadd, pkgmk, etc)

    Platform autodetection will be implemented once someone has been
    annoyed enough by the manual procedure.

  -v <version>

    The version of the build to use. If not specified the script will
    automatically find and download the latest build discovered from
    http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/IDEADEV/Maia+EAP

SOLARIS

  To build a pkgutil repository run bldcat like this:

    bldcat repository/solaris/`uname -p`/`uname -r`
  
  make sure you have the "pkgutilplus" package installed

EXAMPLES

  Example 1: Creating a Solaris package of the latest Ultimate Edition.

  Example 2: Creating a Debian package of the 95.4 build of the Community Edition.

    ./build-package -f IC -p debian -v 95.4
